## Experience

This project was definitely the most difficult one we have done yet. Getting started I began by researching into pug and SQL. The Zybooks this chapter didn't have a lot of good information about how SQL databases can be created, other than with visual tables. Then, I created the container that could take in the information from the user, that would then be created into tasks. After this, the project became increasingly difficult. Pug was relatively easy to work with, especially with the html translator, and with the given for loop I was able to research how to connect the new tasks array to the back-end. Using the given methods from the READ.me, I could use them and change what didn't work. The Post methods were the most difficult to understand, and I don't completely understand them still. Using a mix of Zybooks, and You tube videos about Databases, I was able to properly create the methods. Overall, I still don't completely understand how SQL works or how to connect the databases to the front-end. I wish there was more information in the Zybooks with more practice problems, to help with this project. However, I did learn a little bit about how back-end and front-end connect, and how languages like HTML can be made simpler using other languages like PUG.
